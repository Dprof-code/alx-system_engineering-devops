# System engineering & DevOps

<a href="https://ibb.co/6tn8Rgq"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/jw6zvgj/devopslil.jpg" alt="devopslil" border="0"></a>

I started learning DevOps, Shell and Bash in the [ALX Sofware Engineering program](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering/). In the course of learning, I would be assigned different tasks and projects, so I would be updating this Repo with tasks relating to DevOps, Shell and Bash.

## Projects

- 0x00. Shell, basics
- 0x01. Shell, permissions
- 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters
- 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions
