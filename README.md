# System engineering & DevOps

I started learning DevOps, Shell and Bash in the [ALX Sofware Engineering program](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering/). In the course of learning, I would be assigned different tasks and projects, so I would be updating this Repo with tasks relating to DevOps, Shell and Bash.

## Projects

-0x00. Shell, basics
-0x01. Shell, permissions
-0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters
-0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions
