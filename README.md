# System engineering & DevOps

![](https://ibb.co/6tn8Rgq)

I started learning DevOps, Shell and Bash in the [ALX Sofware Engineering program](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering/). In the course of learning, I would be assigned different tasks and projects, so I would be updating this Repo with tasks relating to DevOps, Shell and Bash.

## Projects

-0x00. Shell, basics \n
-0x01. Shell, permissions \n
-0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters "\n"
-0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions
